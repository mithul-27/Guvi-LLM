## Project Overview
This project involves deploying a fine-tuned GPT model trained on GUVIâ€™s company data using Hugging Face Spaces. The goal is to create a scalable and secure web application, accessible through **Streamlit** or **Gradio**, that allows users to interact with the model. The application supports functionalities like customer support automation, content generation, and educational assistance.

## Project Objectives
- Deploy a pre-trained or fine-tuned **GPT model** using Hugging Face Spaces.
- Develop a **Streamlit** or **Gradio** web application for user interaction with the model.
- Leverage a database to store user data, such as usernames and login times.

## Business Use Cases
1. **Customer Support Automation**: Automate responses to common queries, reducing manual workload.
2. **Content Generation**: Create marketing content like blog posts and social media updates based on user input.
3. **Educational Assistance**: Provide students with a virtual assistant to answer course-related queries.
4. **Internal Knowledge Base**: Enable employees to access internal documents and information efficiently.
5. **Training and Onboarding**: Assist new employees with onboarding by providing access to company policies and materials.

## Approach
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from various GUVI sources such as FAQs, course descriptions, and internal documents.
2. **Model Fine-Tuning**:
   - Preprocess the data (cleaning, tokenization).
   - Fine-tune the GPT model using Hugging Face's **Transformers** library.
3. **Web Application**:
   - Develop an interactive web app using **Streamlit** or **Gradio**.
   - Ensure secure access with a database for user authentication and session tracking.
4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the model and app using Hugging Face Spaces.
   - Ensure scalability and security configurations, such as using IAM roles and security groups.

## Results
- **Functional Web Application**: A working web app accessible to users for interaction with the fine-tuned GPT model.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Leveraged Hugging Face Spaces for a robust and scalable deployment.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation on model fine-tuning, setup, deployment, and usage.

## Project Deliverables
- **Source Code**: Complete source code for the web application.
- **Deployment Scripts**: Scripts to set up and deploy the model on Hugging Face Spaces.
- **Documentation**: Detailed setup and usage guide.
- **Demo**: Optional demo video to showcase the working model.

## Technical Stack
- **Deep Learning**: Fine-tuning GPT models.
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face library for model training and deployment.
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit or Gradio for the web interface.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Hugging Face Spaces for hosting the model and app.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Functionality**: The app should respond correctly to user input and generate accurate text.
- **Performance**: Fast response times for user queries.
- **Scalability**: Support concurrent users without degradation in performance.
- **Security**: Proper security measures for user data.
